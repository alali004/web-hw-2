    <p>13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as the TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series originally developed for Netflix as a limited series by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around high school student Clay Jensen and the aftermath of high school student Hannah Baker’s suicide leaving behind a box of cassette tapes in which she details why she chose to end her life. Through its various storylines, the show explores and depicts a wide range of social issues affecting modern youth, including suicide, sexual assault, bullying, racism, jock culture, mental health, drug addiction, domestic violence, homophobia, deportation, police brutality, steroid use, homelessness, HIV, abortion and school shootings. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners.

        The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.[6] However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape (along with other mature content) prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018 on, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.In July 2019, Netflix edited out the suicide scene in the first season's final episode.
